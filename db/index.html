	    <H2> Break the encryption! </H2>

	    <P>
	      Short of knowing cryptanalysis algirithms, can you break the<BR>
	      encryption of the text that's inside the messages?<br>

	      All we got is 10 encrypted messages, and the program <BR>
	      compares some of them. Your job is to guess words (in English)<BR>
	      and go back and forth between what you guess and what you get.<BR>
	      The more you guess, the more plaintext is revealed.<BR>
	      This is due to the fact that the same (symmetric) key was used to <BR>
	      encrypt all of the messages, turning what was meant to be a Vernam
	      cipher ("One time pad") into a substituion cipher (or "running key cipher").<BR>
	      which is breakable depending on the language analysis.<br><br>

	      The text (which is not reproduced here as plaintext) is courtesy of
	      Standord University.
